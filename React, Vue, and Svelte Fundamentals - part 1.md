# React, Vue, and Svelte Fundamentals - part 1

## Creating an app

Like any modern web framework, the recommended way to scaffold an app is to use a toolchain, such as webpack, esbuild, vite, parcel, or others. Vite (created by the creator of vuejs) is recommended.

### **Apps templates**

The Vite community has created various templates to scaffold web apps using different technologies, such as vanilla javascript, typescript, web workers, and others.

Always check the documentation because it might change: <https://vitejs.dev/.>

## Todo

- Create a folder `vs-apps`
- Inside the folder create (using vite) three apps, one for react, one for svelte, and another one for vue (react-app, vue-app, and svelte-app)
- Explore the structure of the folders: react-app, vue-app, and svelte-app
